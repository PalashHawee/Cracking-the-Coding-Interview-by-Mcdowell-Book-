# Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-by-Mcdowell-Book-

In this repository I'll keep uploading all my practice solutions to the amazing book on "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakman Mcdowell using Python language with different approaches. This repository is corelated to one of my repositories called "Data Structure and Algorithm" and has been extended as a part of my preparations for coding interview.
